# Course Setup

## **Overview**

Canvas Courses are the result of the [Curriculum Development Process](../../../curriculum-development/curriculum-development-process-overview/). Most Canvas Courses are in stages of Development and will be added to or modified throughout the duration of a course's use. 

Most of these pages describe processes undertaken by the LMS Administrator, Instructional Designer, or Curriculum Developers, but they may be useful for Instruction staff to understand in situations where one of the above is not available or a quick fix is needed.
