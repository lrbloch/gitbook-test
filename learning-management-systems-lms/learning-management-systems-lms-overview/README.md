# Learning Management Systems \(LMS\)

## Overview

We use Canvas as our Learning Management System. As a platform, Canvas stores, organizes, and displays courses, course content, assignments, grades, and feedback for learners and instructors. While Slack and Zoom feature heavily in a Learner's day-to-day experience as communication tools, the LMS is the hub of academic activity on a daily basis.

**Courses**

Canvas Courses are Canvas's primary delivery method: when learners are invited to a course, they gain access to all of its material and the ability to submit assignments and receive grades.

**Users**

Canvas Users include:

* Learners - learners access material, submit assignments, and review progress
* Instruction staff - instructors and facilitators view grades and grade assignments
* Student Services - student services monitors student progress for action items
* Product and Learning Science - implementing and improving curriculum and processes
* Studio - data integrations, process automations
