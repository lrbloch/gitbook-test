## Overview

Curriculum Development is a shared responsibility between Product, Learning Science, and Instruction teams. We use [backwards design](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/backward-design-basics/), [ADDIE](https://www.iddblog.org/addie-vs-agile-model-an-instructional-designers-perspective/), and Agile methods to design and develop curriculum.

The following sections describe curriculum development roles and processes, as well as the review process.
